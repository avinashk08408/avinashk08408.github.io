    <h1>🌄 My Unforgettable Journey to Yelagiri</h1>
    <h2>A Travel Diary</h2>

    <div class="chapter">
        <div class="emoji-title">✨ Chapter 1 -- The Plan That Started Everything</div>
        <p>Every memorable trip begins with a decision. Ours began with a simple question:</p>
        <p><em>"Shall we go somewhere this weekend?"</em></p>
        <p>Life had become a cycle of classes, assignments, deadlines, and responsibilities. Everyone needed a break -- something to free our mind and refresh our soul.</p>
        <p>After many suggestions, arguments and laughter, one name won the vote:</p>
        <strong>Yelagiri.</strong>
        <p>We didn't plan it perfectly -- and that was the best part. Spontaneous plans create the strongest memories.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
        <div class="emoji-title">🚗 Chapter 2 -- The Journey Begins</div>
        <p>The excitement began early in the morning -- bags packed, speakers charged, snacks ready, and hearts full of energy.</p>
        <p>As soon as the engine started, so did the fun.</p>
        <p>Songs, laughter, chatter -- everything felt alive.</p>
        <p>The magic started when we began climbing the hills -- the temperature dropped, the world turned greener, and stress disappeared.</p>
        <p>A roadside tea shop owner smiled and said: <em>"Yelagiri varinga? Weather super ah irukum."</em>  
        He was right.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
        <div class="emoji-title">🌲 Chapter 3 -- First Breath of Yelagiri</div>
        <p>The moment we arrived, the silence felt beautiful.</p>
        <p>No horns. No rush. Only wind, birds, and mountains.</p>
        <p>For a few minutes, nobody spoke -- nature was speaking for us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
        <div class="emoji-title">🌊 Chapter 4 -- Punganoor Lake: Where Time Pauses</div>
        <p>The calm water and gentle wind made everything feel magical.</p>
        <p>Boating turned into chaos -- wrong directions, fake screams, and endless selfies -- but laughter made it perfect.</p>
        <p>Snacks after boating tasted heavenly: hot bajji, masala corn, and tea -- simple but unforgettable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
        <div class="emoji-title">🌳 Chapter 5 -- Nature Park & Childhood Flashback</div>
        <p>We entered without expectations… but left with memories.</p>
        <p>For a while, we weren't adults -- we were children again. Running, laughing, playing, lying on the grass -- life felt simple.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
        <div class="emoji-title">🌁 Chapter 6 -- The Viewpoint That Stole Our Hearts</div>
        <p>The climb was tiring but worth it.</p>
        <p>Once we reached the top -- clouds touched the mountains, wind brushed our faces, and the world below looked tiny.</p>
        <p>No one spoke. No one clicked photos. We just stood in silence -- experiencing the moment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
        <div class="emoji-title">☕ Chapter 7 -- Snacks, Sunset & Soulful Conversations</div>
        <p>Watching the sunset felt peaceful -- orange, red, purple, blue.</p>
        <p>We spoke about dreams, fears, life -- not assignments or pressure.</p>
        <p>Trips like these heal us silently.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
        <div class="emoji-title">🔥 Chapter 8 -- Night Vibes & Endless Memories</div>
        <p>Night arrived with music, games, jokes, and warmth.</p>
        <p>At one point, silence filled the room -- not awkward, but emotional.</p>
        <p>Everyone knew -- this moment would stay forever.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
        <div class="emoji-title">❤️ Chapter 9 -- The Morning Goodbye</div>
        <p>Leaving was harder than reaching.</p>
        <p>The return was quieter -- not sad, but full of memories.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
        <div class="emoji-title">💫 Final Chapter -- What Yelagiri Taught Me</div>
        <p>This wasn't just a trip -- it was a reminder.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Happiness is simple</li>
            <li>Nature is medicine</li>
            <li>Memories are treasure</li>
            <li>Life isn't a race -- sometimes we must pause</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>We didn't return as the same people who left.</strong></p>
    </div>
